# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Goal
My 100-days-of-code will focus on JavaScript. Some days will focus on nothing more than a refresher on JS, however I do have an overarching theme which will be to develop and deploy an Android application using React Native and D3. I am giving myself 100 days to create a homebrew tracking app. These sorts of tracking apps already exist, so anyone looking for a ready made solution can find one on the Google Play Store. My interest here is to create D3 figures using timeseries data.


### Day 0: July 08, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Setup and planning. Github repo creation. Created docs folder. Installed required packages. Created React Native App. Commited changes to project repo.

**Thoughts:** Installation took longer than expected so I decided to call this day zero and I will start coding tomorrow.

**Today's Progress**: Restructured app layout for components/containers and implemented styles. 

**Thoughts:** This hour dissapeared really quickly! So much to do!

### Day 2: July 10, 2018  

**Today's Progress**: Created brewtrackers first button. Added a function to change state. Started thinking about app design.

**Thoughts:** Still catching myself writing Python.

### Day 3: July 11, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Investigated screen layout; specifically, divided the screen into 6 equal parts. Each area will eventually hold an image and become a button.

**Thoughts:** Nothing technical. Get 'er done.

### Day 4: July 12, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Navigation between screens. Added placeholder text instead of ugly colours. 

**Thoughts:** Lots of repetition to create mutltiple screens. Once I had created one, the rest was cake.

### Day 5: July 13, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Created a reusable component - the back button.  

**Thoughts:** I need to look at arrow functions, passing props to components, and export methods such as *withNavigation*. Also I need to start using icons to get this app looking spiffy.

### Day 6: July 14, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Added Icons.

**Thoughts:** Icons make all the difference!

### Day 7: July 15, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Added a date picker. Started using lifecycle events to setup components. Specifically, componentWillMount().

**Thoughts:** Using existing components like react-native-datepicker will make app development a speedy process.

### Day 8: July 16, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** I looked at different user input methods; TextInput, Single select and multi-select modals.

**Thoughts:** All of the data should be put into its own file and imported as required. I will look at refactoring the 'New Screen' page next.

### Day 9: July 17, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Cleaning up the layout of "New Screen" so it's a little nicer to look at.

**Thoughts:** One could spend weeks/months/years tinkering with UI!

### Day 10: July 18, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Using static data files.

**Thoughts:** Dealing wiht data was easy. But I got into a mess of things while trying to install and subsequently uninstalled wheel-picker components.

### Day 11: July 19, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Fetch data from API

**Thoughts:** My emulator is running like a slug!

### Day 12: July 22, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Remove API fetch. Created Sectioned List using the hops data saved to file (hops.js).

**Thoughts:** Skipped some days for family bizzo. I did a little reading around the topic of my app... basically I read/brewed some beer.

### Day 13: July 23, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Render a table.

**Thoughts:** Things I need to brush up on include, loops, arrays and functions. Ive been writing Python code all day at work so I am still looking up basic syntax.

### Day 14: July 24, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** More on tables. A little refresher on JS.

**Thoughts:** Solved my emulator-slug issue by wiping the user data and rebuilding the app.

### Day 15: July 25, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Customize table data.

**Thoughts:** Interesting challenge solved using a placeholder property. I had to stop the table from getting duplicate/triplicate entries.

### Day 16: July 26, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Add a delete button to each row in the table.

**Thoughts:** I am shocked this worked without a hitch! Still need to modify the style of the table but for now it will do.

**Link to documents:** [docs/day016.md](docs/day016.md)  


### Day 17: July 27, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Nada.

**Thoughts:** I hit a wall while trying to add different buttons for each cell of each row in the existing table. I will need to think about conditional rendering and potentially deleting the table entirely and creating a flatlist containing the buttons I want.

### Day 18: July 29, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** FlatLists.

**Thoughts:** It was rather messy updating this code. Lots of trial and error. FlatLists are great, no point wasting time using a table.

### Day 19: July 30, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Modals.

**Thoughts:** I have used plenty of modals already. I think I will just render a button or use a text input area to add quantity and boil times.

### Day 20: August 1, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Sliders.

**Thoughts:** Using sliders gives a much better user experience than the modal IMO. I did however find that my code has several errors. I need to be able to add multiple hops with the same name which can be updated independently. At the moment hops with the same name get updated together. I will need to review the spread operator and indexOf() to figure out whats going on.

### Day 21: August 2, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Debugging

**Thoughts:** Lots messing about trying to get the debugger running. Given the amount of time I spent trying to get the chrome debugger working, I'd reckon I'd be better off just rendering state changes as a text component! Ill probably do this tomorrow. I did have some luck with the stand alone react-dev tools but it was too little too late.
