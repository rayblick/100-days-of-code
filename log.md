# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Goal
My 100-days-of-code will focus on JavaScript. Some days will focus on nothing more than a refresher on JS, however I do have an overarching theme which will be to develop and deploy an Android application using React Native and D3. I am giving myself 100 days to create a homebrew tracking app. These sorts of tracking apps already exist, so anyone looking for a ready made solution can find one on the Google Play Store. My interest here is to create D3 figures using timeseries data.


### Day 0: July 08, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Setup and planning. Github repo creation. Created docs folder. Installed required packages. Created React Native App. Commited changes to project repo.

**Thoughts:** Installation took longer than expected so I decided to call this day zero and I will start coding tomorrow.

### Day 2: July 10, 2018  

**Today's Progress**: Created brewtrackers first button. Added a function to change state. Started thinking about app design.

**Thoughts:** Still catching myself writing Python.

### Day 3: July 11, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Investigated screen layout; specifically, divided the screen into 6 equal parts. Each area will eventually hold an image and become a button.

**Thoughts:** Nothing technical. Get 'er done.

### Day 4: July 12, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Navigation between screens. Added placeholder text instead of ugly colours. 

**Thoughts:** Lots of repetition to create mutltiple screens. Once I had created one, the rest was cake.

**Link to documents:** [docs/day004.md](docs/day004.md)  


### Day 5: July 13, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Created a reusable component - the back button.  

**Thoughts:** I need to look at arrow functions, passing props to components, and export methods such as *withNavigation*. Also I need to start using icons to get this app looking spiffy.

**Link to documents:** [docs/day005.md](docs/day005.md)  


### Day 6: July 14, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Added Icons.

**Thoughts:** Icons make all the difference!

### Day 7: July 15, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Added a date picker. Started using lifecycle events to setup components. Specifically, componentWillMount().

**Thoughts:** Using existing components like react-native-datepicker will make app development a speedy process.

**Link to documents:** [docs/day007.md](docs/day007.md)  


### Day 8: July 16, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** I looked at different user input methods; TextInput, Single select and multi-select modals.

**Thoughts:** All of the data should be put into its own file and imported as required. I will look at refactoring the 'New Screen' page next.

### Day 9: July 17, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Cleaning up the layout of "New Screen" so it's a little nicer to look at.

**Thoughts:** One could spend weeks/months/years tinkering with UI!

### Day 10: July 18, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Using static data files.

**Thoughts:** Dealing wiht data was easy. But I got into a mess of things while trying to install and subsequently uninstalled wheel-picker components.

### Day 11: July 19, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Fetch data from API

**Thoughts:** My emulator is running like a slug!

**Link to documents:** [docs/day011.md](docs/day011.md)  


### Day 12: July 22, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Remove API fetch. Created Sectioned List using the hops data saved to file (hops.js).

**Thoughts:** Skipped some days for family bizzo. I did a little reading around the topic of my app... basically I read/brewed some beer.

**Link to documents:** [docs/day012.md](docs/day012.md)  


### Day 13: July 23, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Render a table.

**Thoughts:** Things I need to brush up on include, loops, arrays and functions. Ive been writing Python code all day at work so I am still looking up basic syntax.

**Link to documents:** [docs/day013.md](docs/day013.md)  


### Day 14: July 24, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** More on tables. A little refresher on JS.

**Thoughts:** Solved my emulator-slug issue by wiping the user data and rebuilding the app.

**Link to documents:** [docs/day014.md](docs/day014.md)  


### Day 15: July 25, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Customize table data.

**Thoughts:** Interesting challenge solved using a placeholder property. I had to stop the table from getting duplicate/triplicate entries.

**Link to documents:** [docs/day015.md](docs/day015.md)  


### Day 16: July 26, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Add a delete button to each row in the table.

**Thoughts:** I am shocked this worked without a hitch! Still need to modify the style of the table but for now it will do.

**Link to documents:** [docs/day016.md](docs/day016.md)  


### Day 17: July 27, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Nada.

**Thoughts:** I hit a wall while trying to add different buttons for each cell of each row in the existing table. I will need to think about conditional rendering and potentially deleting the table entirely and creating a flatlist containing the buttons I want.

**Link to documents:** [docs/day017.md](docs/day017.md)  


### Day 18: July 29, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** FlatLists.

**Thoughts:** It was rather messy updating this code. Lots of trial and error. FlatLists are great, no point wasting time using a table.

### Day 19: July 30, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Modals.

**Thoughts:** I have used plenty of modals already. I think I will just render a button or use a text input area to add quantity and boil times.

**Link to documents:** [docs/day019.md](docs/day019.md)  


### Day 20: August 1, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Sliders.

**Thoughts:** Using sliders gives a much better user experience than the modal IMO. I did however find that my code has several errors. I need to be able to add multiple hops with the same name which can be updated independently. At the moment hops with the same name get updated together. I will need to review the spread operator and indexOf() to figure out whats going on.

### Day 21: August 2, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Debugging

**Thoughts:** Lots messing about trying to get the debugger running. Given the amount of time I spent trying to get the chrome debugger working, I'd reckon I'd be better off just rendering state changes as a text component! Ill probably do this tomorrow. I did have some luck with the stand alone react-dev tools but it was too little too late.

**Link to documents:** [docs/day021.md](docs/day021.md)  


### Day 22: August 4, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** More on debugging

**Thoughts:** I actually had the Chrome dev tools working. I just needed to log some objects to the console.

**Link to documents:** [docs/day022.md](docs/day022.md)  


### Day 23: August 5, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Creating random numbers and creating deep copies of objects in an array.

**Thoughts:** Solved the horrid bug!! Chrome dev tools helped me track down what was going on in my code, and it wasnt what I thought it was! Sure my code was wrong but not the part I was trying to solve - I didnt realise that assigning an array of objects was not creating a copy! Stupid me, of course it doesn't!

### Day 24: August 6, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Adding extra sliders and buttons.

**Thoughts:** NewScreen is getting messy with all the styles. I will definitely need to spend a day cleaning up this code.

**Link to documents:** [docs/day024.md](docs/day024.md)  


### Day 25: August 8, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Conditional rendering of styles.

**Thoughts:** Lots of options when using an array for styles. The ternary operator seems like the best of option for me (for now).

**Link to documents:** [docs/day025.md](docs/day025.md)  


### Day 26: August 9, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Collecting data - grains.js.

**Thoughts:** I want to allow the entry of malts and grains, but before I do I need to accumulate a little data.

**Link to documents:** [docs/day026.md](docs/day026.md)  


### Day 27: August 11, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Time to refactor NewScreen.

**Thoughts:** Too much clutter with styles and ad-hoc components. Seems to be a resonable approach though... build it, make it work, clean it up. Might have to do a little reading on front-end dev between coding sessions.

### Day 29: August 13, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Continued refactoring

**Thoughts:** Todays refactoring turned into duplication. I have added in functionality to add grains to the recipe. I have duplicated the procedure for hops by creating indiviudal methods, and now that its working I will go through and remove the duplication.

### Day 30: August 14, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Continued refactoring

**Thoughts:** Lots more refactoring to do!

### Day 31: August 17, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Prepare data to be saved

**Thoughts:** The NewScreen page which saves original recipes is far from done. However, it has sufficient information to start considering how the data will be saved (Realm or Firebase etc).

**Link to documents:** [docs/day031.md](docs/day031.md)  


### Day 32: August 18, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Firebase - reading

**Thoughts:** I am looking to save data from NewScreen page to a server. Firebase looks good. Ill give that a go. More to follow soon.

### Day 33: August 19, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Brewed beer

**Thoughts:** This app has to be functional for users. Its not coding but who cares, if I don't know what data to save, no amount of coding will help.

### Day 34: August 20, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Read about brewing beer

**Thoughts:** Lots of brew investigation. I think I need to covert reading into tasting.

### Day 42: September 11, 2018  

**Today's Progress:** Learnt about the keyword "this"
