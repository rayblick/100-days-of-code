# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Goal
My 100-days-of-code will focus on JavaScript. Some days will focus on nothing more than a refresher on JS, however I do have an overarching theme which will be to develop and deploy an Android application using React Native and D3. I am giving myself 100 days to create a homebrew tracking app. These sorts of tracking apps already exist, so anyone looking for a ready made solution can find one on the Google Play Store. My interest here is to create D3 figures using timeseries data.


### Day 0: July 08, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Setup and planning. Github repo creation. Created docs folder. Installed required packages. Created React Native App. Commited changes to project repo.

**Thoughts:** Installation took longer than expected so I decided to call this day zero and I will start coding tomorrow.
