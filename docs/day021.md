**Problem**  
The flatlist on the NewScreen page has an error. Specifically the updating and deleting functions are not currently accessing the correct elements to change. I found this error when adding multiple hops of the same name; when changing the quantity or deleting, more than one item would change values.

**Ideas**
* Try using debug in chrome (DIDN'T GET PASSED THIS PROBLEM TODAY)
* Problem with the spread operator
* Problem with indexOf
* Problem with unique keys in the flatlist


1. Debug not working! I have burnt over an hour trying to figure this out. This stack overflow issue basically sums up my problem https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49340074/chrome-debug-tools-for-react-native-mutiple-issues/49676564 

2. What version of React-Native do I have installed?
```ps
G:\brewtracker>react-native -v
react-native-cli: 2.0.1
react-native: 0.55.4
```

3. Some solutions... none helped me

4. Try standalone dev tools
https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/tree/master/packages/react-devtools 
```js
// install and run
npm install -g react-devtools
react-devtools

// second window
Run emulator
react-native run-android
```
