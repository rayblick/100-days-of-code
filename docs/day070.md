# Day 070

**November 17, 2018**

Setting up a node. And by node I am referring to another Raspberry Pi that will record data via the Flask API, Postgres DB and the React Webapp.

### Setup the Pi
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

### Install Grove Pi
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y python-smbus i2c-tools
curl -kL dexterindustries.com/update_grovepi | bash
mkdir repos/grovepi
nano temphumisensor.py
```

### temphumisensor.py

Note that I have added in a procedure to collect 60 observations over 1 minute because I noticed large changes over the space of 1 second (e.g. 23 jumping to 26 and back again). From the 60 measurements I take the median as the best guess. This is because the sensor has an accuracy of +-2 degrees C, so the obvious way forward is to get a better sensor.
```py
from grovepi import *
import time
import statistics

dht_sensor_port = 4 
dht_sensor_type = 0
number_of_samples = 60

t = []
h = []
for n in range(number_of_samples):
    temp, hum = dht(dht_sensor_port, dht_sensor_type)
    t.append(temp)
    h.append(hum)
    time.sleep(1)


tp = [e for e in t if isinstance(e, float)]
hm = [i for i in h if isinstance(i, float)]


print(statistics.median(tp), statistics.median(hm))
```
