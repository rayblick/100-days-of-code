# Day 22

**August 02, 2018** 

The following "problem" and "ideas" copy/pasted from day 21. I need to get the debugging working.

**Problem**  
The flatlist on the NewScreen page has an error. Specifically the updating and deleting functions are not currently accessing the correct elements to change. I found this error when adding multiple hops of the same name; when changing the quantity or deleting, more than one item would change values.

**Ideas**
* Try using debug in chrome (DIDN'T GET PASSED THIS PROBLEM TODAY)
* Problem with the spread operator
* Problem with indexOf
* Problem with unique keys in the flatlist



1. Run emulator

2. Open chrome and go to http://localhost:8081/debugger-ui/ 

3. Run react-native
```ps
react-native run-android
```

4. Shake gesture (ctrl-m)

5. Select: Debug JS Remotely, Enable Live Reload, Enable Hot Reloading

6. In chrome select Menu (three vertical dots) > More Tools > Developer tools, also select Maintain Priority on the landing page.

7. Add console.log to deleteHops method
```js
  deleteHop(item) {
    var tableDataTemp = [...this.state.tableData]
    let idx = tableDataTemp.indexOf(item);
    tableDataTemp.splice(idx, 1)
    this.setState({
      tableData: tableDataTemp
    }, ()=> console.log(tableData)) //<== HERE
  }
```

8. On the emulator reload (press r twice)

9. Navigate to NewScreen

10. Enter 6 selections of hops (3 names twice) for testing

11. Note that there are warnings of Flatlist not containing items with a unique key. This is what I need to fix.

12. Review each object sent to Console using console.log
