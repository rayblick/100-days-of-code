# Day 3

**July 11, 2018**  

Screen layout. Today I divided the RootContainer into six equal parts. Each area will eventually become a button that navigates to other areas of my app.

All changes made occurred in the render method. I have removed the code for the button and text for clarity. I want two columns and three rows. 

The rowContainer style includes flexDirection: 'row'. Then, two View components are given equal flex property (i.e. 1+ 1 = 2, which is the same as giving 50% each). Then I have replicated this three times. The ugly colour scheme is just for my notes.

```js
  render () {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>

        <View style={styles.rowContainer}>
          <View style={{flex:1,backgroundColor:'grey'}}/>
          <View style={{flex:1,backgroundColor:'orange'}}/>
        </View>

        <View style={styles.rowContainer}>
          <View style={{flex:1,backgroundColor:'blue'}}/>
          <View style={{flex:1,backgroundColor:'red'}}/>
        </View>

        <View style={styles.rowContainer}>
          <View style={{flex:1,backgroundColor:'purple'}}/>
          <View style={{flex:1,backgroundColor:'green'}}/>
        </View>
      </View>
    )
  }
```
