# Day 29

**August 13, 2018** 

The goal for today was to refactor. However, since I decided to add in another modal for selecting grains (similar to the process for hops) I have ended up duplicating almost all of the functions on the NewScreen page. I have done this on purpose because I want to spend some time considering the best way to refactor and clean this code.


TODO:  
a. ~~Ensure each cardItem can alter tableData~~   
     (needs to be renamed to "recipeData" now that I am not using tables)
b. ~~add delete functionality to RecipeCard~~  
c. ~~add boil time and quantity functionality to RecipeCard~~  
d. refactor all styles 
e. remove duplication of methods for grains and hops 


Here is an example of the duplication I have created.
```js
  getExistingKeys(objs){
    // hops
    tableData = this.state.tableData
    arrayOfKeys = []
    for (var obj in tableData){
      arrayOfKeys.push(obj['key'])
    }
    return arrayOfKeys
  }

  getExistingKeysGrains(objs){
    // grains
    grainData = this.state.grainData
    arrayOfKeys = []
    for (var obj in grainData){
      arrayOfKeys.push(obj['key'])
    }
    return arrayOfKeys
  }
```

This one will probably look like this...
```js
  getExistingKeys(objs, dat){
    arrayOfKeys = []
    for (var obj in dat){
      arrayOfKeys.push(obj['key'])
    }
    return arrayOfKeys
  }
```

However, I will spend some time on each duplicate function so that I consider alternative processing methodology. For example, is there a cleaner way of collecting 'keys' from multiple objects in an array? I am sure there is.


This is what NewScreen looks like now...
