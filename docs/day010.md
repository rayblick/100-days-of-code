# Day 10

**July 18, 2018** 

Today was mainly about using data from a static file. I wanted to do this so these data could be used in multiple places in the app later on, and because I didnt want to repeat myself (DRY). Heres the steps I took to work with static files.

1. Create new file in Data/hops.js and add the data with **export default**
```js
export default [
    {  
      name: "Australian",
      id: 1,
      children: [{
          name: "Pride of Ringwood",
          id: 101,
        },//snipped
        {
          name: "Ella",
          id: 109,
        },{
          name: "Enigma",
          id: 110,
        }]
    },
    {
      name: "American",
      id: 2,
      children: [{
          name: "Cascade",
          id: 201,
    //snipped
        }]
    },
]
```

2. Import into screen.
```js
import hops from '../Data/hops';
```

3. Use the data.
```js
//snipped
      <ScrollView style={{flex: 1}}>
        <MultiSelect
          hideTags
          items={hops} //<=== Data
          //snipped
```
