# Day 9

**July 17, 2018**  

I have been dumping a bunch of user input boxes into the "New Screen" page. Today's job is to make it look a little better than it does now. 

I found it useful to know what was expected for styling components. Here is one example. 
```js
//snipped
        <MultiSelect
          //snipped
          styles = {{
            container: {
              paddingHorizontal: 10
            }
          }}
//snipped
```
Here is another example. 
```js
        <ModalSelector
            //snipped
            >
            <TextInput
                style={{fontSize: 20,
                    padding: 15, 
                    color: 'black', 
                    width: 300,
                    textAlign: 'center'}}
                //snipped
            />
        </ModalSelector>

```
Another example...
```js
    <DatePicker
        //snipped
        customStyles={{
            dateInput: {
                borderWidth:0,
            },
            dateText:{
            fontSize: 24,
            color: 'grey',
            }
        }}
        //snipped
    />
```
