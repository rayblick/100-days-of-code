# Day 40

Back to calculating IBUs!

Todays notes are about getting the length of an array that contains a bunch of objects. I have decided to document this because it took me far too long to figure this out! This is kind of funny because the solution is very similar to what I did yesterday. Heres what happened.

1. I want to select items for my recipe including malt extract and hops. If the number of each type of ingredient is more than 1 for both groups then make some arbitrary adjustment to the IBU property.

This is how I am calling and checking the output, along with what I thought would work! It didn't.
```js
  recipeIBU() {
    try {
      var edat = this.state.extractData.length
      var hdat = this.state.hopData.length
      if (edat > 0 && hdat > 0) {
        this.setState({
          IBU: 100
        })
      } 
    } catch(err) {
        console.log(err.message);
    }
  } 

  submitData(){
    this.recipeIBU()
    var data = {
      //snipped
      extract: this.state.extractData,
      hops: this.state.hopData,
      ibu: this.state.IBU
    }
    console.log(data)
    alert(this.formatData(data))
  }
```

2. Heres what I had to do to get it to work! Turns out I'm a moron, the data I want is the length of an object. Wait, am I a losing it? The debug screen reckons its an array, but with indexes? Why is it that I can get the length of keys for an array? 
```js
  recipeIBU() {
    try {
      var edat = Object.keys(this.state.extractData).length //<====
      var hdat = Object.keys(this.state.hopData).length //<====
      if (edat > 0 && hdat > 0) {
        this.setState({
          IBU: 100
        })
      } 
    } catch(err) {
        console.log(err.message);
    }
  } 
```
