# Day 18

**July 29, 2018** 

I missed a day yesterday. However, I did invest some time reviewing what I consider important in my app. I did a little homebrewing as well. I bottled my next batch of IPA (Magnum and Cascade hops) and wrote out some of the important components that I wanted to include when recording data.

Here are some things that must be included;

* Did I use grain infusion - what type/brand?
* How did I use the malt extract (1/3 initially and 2/3 after 50 mins of boil time)
* Which hops did I use? 
* Record multiple hops at different time points during the boil (extract brewing)
* What is the specific gravity before pitching the yeast?
* What type of yeast? 
* What is the temperature when pitching the yeast?

I also bought some supplies to experiment with;

* Cascade hops
* Amarillo hops
* Citra hops
* Simcoe hops


**Today**  
Now over to today's code. I am going to remove the table on NewScreen and replace it with a flatlist (https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flatlist). Each item will be shown as a "HopCard" which will render the ability to delete the record, set the quantity used and the boil time.

1. Update imports
```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import { 
  View, 
  Text,
  TextInput,
  TouchableOpacity, 
  FlatList, //<======= NEW
  ScrollView } from 'react-native'
import styles from './Styles/NewScreenStyles';
import DatePicker from 'react-native-datepicker';
import ModalSelector from 'react-native-modal-selector';
import MultiSelect  from 'react-native-sectioned-multi-select';
import Icon from 'react-native-vector-icons/FontAwesome';
import hops from '../Data/hops';
/*import { 
  Cell,
  Table,
  TableWrapper, 
  Row, 
  Rows } from 'react-native-table-component';*/
```

2. Update methods bound to NewScreen
```js
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    //this.get_table_data = this.get_table_data.bind(this);
    this.clearSelectObjects = this.clearSelectObjects.bind(this);
    this.state = {
      date: '2018-01-01',
      title: 'Batch name',
      group: 'beer',
      method: '',
      beerType: '',
      vol: '',
      fermenterType: '',
      selectedItems: [],
      dataSource: [],
      //tableHead: ['delete', 'hop', 'volume', 'time'],
      tableData: [],
      tableTemp: [],
      test: ''
     };
  }
```

3. Delete the table component (not shown)

4. Add flatlist. Note the three important ingredients;

* data  
* renderItem  
* keyExtractor (need to do extract work to use this one.. see below) 

```js
    <View style={{borderWidth: 1}}>
        <FlatList
            style={{flex: 1}}
            data={this.state.tableData}
            renderItem={({item}) => this.renderHopCard(item)}
            keyExtractor={item => item.key}
        />
    </View>
```

5. Create renderHopCard. Styles included for now - need to refactor this.  
```js
  renderHopCard(cardItem) {
    return (
      <View style={{flexDirection:'row'}}>
        <TouchableOpacity 
          style={{alignItems:'center'}}
          onPress={() => this.deleteHop(cardItem)}>
          <Icon name="trash" size={20} color="black" />
        </TouchableOpacity>
        <Text style={{fontSize:20}}>{cardItem.name}</Text>
      </View>
    )
  }
```
6. Create deleteHop. I had an issue where I was only left with the item I wanted to remove. I found the solution here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49991229/cant-delete-item-from-flatlist 
```js
  deleteHop(item) {
    var tableDataTemp = [...this.state.tableData]
    let idx = tableDataTemp.indexOf(item);
    tableDataTemp.splice(idx, 1)
    this.setState({
      tableData: tableDataTemp
    })
  }
```

7. Now I needed to make sure the data would be saved correctly to be displayed in the flatlist. Recall the original data looks like this. 
```js
// Data/hops.js
export default [
    {  
      name: "Australian",
      id: 1,
      data: [{
          name: "Pride of Ringwood",
          id: 101,
          alpha: 9.6,
          alpha_range: [8.6, 10.5],
          beta: 5.7,
          beta_range: [4.4, 7],
          oil: 1.7,
          oil_range:  [1.6, 1.8],
          commercial: ['Ale', 'IPA'],
          aroma: ['Herbal', 'Cedar', 'Oak'],
          hopType: 'Aroma'
        },{
          name: "Melba",
          id: 102,
          alpha: 0,
          alpha_range: [0, 0],
          beta: 0,
          beta_range: [0, 0],
          oil: 0,
          oil_range:  [0, 0],
          commercial: ['', ''],
          aroma: ['', '', ''],
          hopType: ''
        }

```

8. hops.js is rendered in the 'react-native-sectioned-multi-select' component as a modal. This component has several function calls. The first one is called **onSelectedItemsChange** which takes affect when items are selected or deselected.
```js
  onSelectedItemsChange = (selectedItems) => {
    this.setState({ selectedItems });
  }
```

9. The next function is called **onSelectedObjectsChange** which puts all of the selected hops in a temporary list as objects.
```js
  onSelectedObjectsChange = (selectedObjects) => {
    this.setState({
      tableTemp: selectedObjects
    })
  }
```

10. The last argument is called onConfirm which calls **clearSelectObjects**. I have made several updates here;

* I use arr1.push.appy(arr1, arr2) to concatenate arrays instead of using a for loop.  
* I have created a function called **createUniqueKey** (shown next) which is responsible for providing a unique key to the flatlist component.  
* The existing approach of removing all toggle selections from the multiselect component remain as they were.  
```js
  clearSelectObjects = (selectedItems) => {
    td = this.state.tableData
    tt = this.state.tableTemp
    td.push.apply(td, tt)
    this.setState({
      tableData: this.createUniqueKey(td),
    }, ()=>this.setState({
      selectedItems: [],
      tableTemp: []
    }))
  }
```

11. Create a unique key for each object in a list. Note that you get a warning if you dont convert the key to a string. No idea why.
```js
  createUniqueKey(objs){
    tableArray = []
    for (i=0; i<objs.length; i++){
      unique_key = i+1
      dat = objs[i]
      dat['key'] = unique_key.toString();
      tableArray.push(dat)
    }
    return tableArray
  }
```
